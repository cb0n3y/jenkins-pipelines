- Directory structure and main components.
- Key files that Jenkins will build and test.

---

## 🐳 Using Docker as a Build Environment

- Running Jenkins agents in Docker containers.
- Using Docker images as isolated build environments.
- Benefits of reproducible builds and consistent environments.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Jenkins in Docker

- Common issues when running Jenkins inside Docker.
- Checking container logs and permissions.
- Networking considerations (e.g., Git access from the container).

---

## 📂 Workspace Synchronization

- Understanding how Jenkins workspaces are used.
- Using `cleanWs()` to reset the workspace.
- Sharing artifacts between stages and builds.

---

- Cloning, fetching, and checking out branches.
- Best practices for multi-branch pipelines.

---

## ⚙️ Building the Project

- Using `sh` steps to execute build commands.
- Running Docker commands from Jenkins pipelines.
- Archiving build artifacts for later stages.

---

## 🏛️ Revisiting Jenkins Architecture

- Overview of Jenkins master-agent architecture.
- How pipelines execute across agents.
- Role of declarative vs. scripted pipelines.

---

## 🎭 Running E2E tests with Playwright

- Installing Playwright in the build environment.
- Writing simple end-to-end tests for your website project.
- Running tests from Jenkins pipelines using `sh` steps.
- Capturing test results for reporting.

---

## 📊 Publishing an HTML Report

- Archiving HTML reports generated by builds.
- Using `publishHTML` or similar plugins to visualize test results.
- Linking reports to the Jenkins job UI for easy access.

---

## ⚡ Running Stages in Parallel

- Using the `parallel` directive in declarative pipelines.
- Examples of running multiple test suites or build tasks simultaneously.
- Benefits of faster builds with parallel execution.

---

## 🌊 Jenkins Blue Ocean Plugin

- Installing and using the Blue Ocean UI plugin.
- Visualizing pipeline stages, parallel execution, and logs.
- Advantages over the classic Jenkins UI for CI/CD monitoring.

---

## 🏗️ How to Structure a Pipeline

- Best practices for organizing pipeline stages and steps.
- Using environment variables and shared libraries.
- Tips for readability and maintainability of declarative pipelines.

---

## ⬆️ How to Update Jenkins and Its Plugins

- Updating Jenkins core safely.
- Updating installed plugins from the UI or CLI.
- Managing plugin dependencies and compatibility.

---

## 📝 Assignments

- **Assignment 1:** Create a simple CI pipeline for the website project.
- **Assignment 2:** Integrate Docker-based build steps.
- **Assignment 3:** Implement workspace cleanup and artifact archiving.
- **Assignment 4:** Run a Playwright E2E test in your pipeline.
- **Assignment 5:** Publish an HTML report for your test results.
- **Assignment 6:** Refactor a pipeline to run multiple stages in parallel.
- **Assignment 7:** Explore the Blue Ocean interface and document observations.

## 🗒️ Notes

- All exercises are designed to be incremental, building on previous concepts.
- Use the `files/` folder in each day’s subdirectory for reference Jenkinsfiles and scripts.
- Keep experimenting with parameters, environment variables, and multiple stages.
