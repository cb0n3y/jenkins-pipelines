# 🛠️ jenkins-pipelines

Welcome to **jenkins-pipelines** — a personal learning repository where I document my day-by-day progress in mastering **Jenkins Pipelines**.

This repo is intended to be a living knowledge base that grows as I explore Jenkins automation, CI/CD best practices, and pipeline scripting techniques.

---

## 📚 What to Expect

In this repository, you'll find:

- 🧪 **Daily learning logs** with code examples and explanations
- 📦 Jenkins **Pipeline-as-Code** scripts (`Jenkinsfile`)
- 🔄 Declarative and scripted pipeline examples
- 🛠️ Common CI/CD patterns and real-world use cases
- 🧵 Notes on Jenkins plugins, integrations, and DSL usage

---

## 📅 Daily Log Structure

Each day will be organized as a separate folder or markdown file:

```text
jenkins-pipelines/
├── day-01/
│ ├── README.md
│ └── Jenkinsfile
├── day-02/
│ ├── README.md
│ └── Jenkinsfile
```

> 📌 Each day's folder will include a `README.md` summarizing the concepts learned, and a working `Jenkinsfile` or snippet to demonstrate it.
